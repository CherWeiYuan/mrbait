mrbait: Universal identification and design of targeted-enrichment capture probes
=================================================================================


mrbait is a software pipeline for identifying regions of interest in DNA
sequence data and designing probes to enrich them.

The motivation behind mrbait is ease and flexibility of use. As such, mrbait
allows a variety of input types and facilitates a diverse array of bait design
approaches, such as those targeting ultraconserved elements, RAD-capture methods,
or those targeting exons or other genomic elements. mrbait also
