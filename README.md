Python program for universal design of targeted-enrichment probes from multiple input datatypes. Can be used to generate probe sets for ultraconserved elements, anchored enrichment, RAD-capture, etc. 

Currently in development. Contact me at tkchafin@uark.edu if you are interested in progress or contributing.
